# Morse Code Explained

## Overview of Morse Code

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations: short signals (dots or "dits") and long signals (dashes or "dahs"). These signals can be transmitted as on-off tones, lights, or clicks, allowing for communication over various mediums.

## Historical Context

Morse code was invented in the 1830s by Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Vail, primarily for use with the electrical telegraph. Its creation addressed the need for a reliable and efficient long-distance communication system. The code became widely adopted during the 19th and 20th centuries, playing a crucial role in telegraphy, maritime communication, and military operations before the advent of more advanced telecommunication technologies.

## How the Morse Code System Works

The Morse code system represents letters, numbers, and punctuation marks using unique combinations of dots and dashes. Each character has a specific sequence assigned to it (e.g., 'E' is a single dot, 'T' is a single dash). The system relies on precise timing:
- A dot represents a short unit of time.
- A dash represents three units of time.
- The space between elements within a character (dots and dashes) is one unit of time
- The space between characters is three units of time.
- The space between words is seven units of time. 
**Examples:**

*   **E:** • (single dot)
*   **T:** — (single dash)
*   **I:** •• (two dots)
*   **A:** •— (dot followed by a dash)
*   **M:** —— (two dashes)
*   **SOS:** •••———••• (three dots, three dashes, three dots - a well-known distress signal)
